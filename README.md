This is a face recognition attendance system.

On website there are two options --> Create User and Mark Attendance

Creating a User will take 50 photos to train the model and get the correct name of User.

Then after creating user, we can mark their attendance and model will automatically detect who is the user.

The person's attendance for that day will be displayed on the webpage as well as in the .csv file.

To use this project, just install the dependencies and hit play, it will be hosted on localhost.
